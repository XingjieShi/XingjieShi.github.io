## Introduction 
It is common to have multiple outcomes of interest in a single study. Usually, these outcomes are analysed separately, ignoring the correlation between them. In high dimensional setting, one would expect that a carefully designed multivariate approach would be a more efficient alternative to individual analyses of each outcome [cite]. For jointly modeling multiple correlated outcomes, we have developed the method [__vimco__](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-abstract/35/19/3693/5372680?redirectedFrom=fulltext). Here we provide same demonstrations.
 
Assume we have measured $q$ responses $y_1, \dots, y_q$ and the same set of $p$ predictors on each individual $x_1,\dots, x_p$. Each response has its own regression model:
$$h(y_i) =  x_i^\top\beta + \varepsilon_i, ~ i=1, \dots, n,$$
where $\beta$ is the regression vector.
