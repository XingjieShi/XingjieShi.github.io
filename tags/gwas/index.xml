      <description>Introduction It is common to have multiple outcomes of interest in a single study. Usually, these outcomes are analysed separately, ignoring the correlation between them. In high dimensional setting, one would expect that a carefully designed multivariate approach would be a more efficient alternative to individual analyses of each outcome [Rothman et al.,2010]. For jointly modeling multiple correlated outcomes in GWAS, we have developed a statisitcal method in this paper.</description>
