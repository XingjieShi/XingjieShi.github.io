      <description>Introduction It is common to have multiple outcomes of interest in a single study. Usually, these outcomes are analysed separately, ignoring the correlation between them. In high dimensional setting, one would expect that a carefully designed multivariate approach would be a more efficient alternative to individual analyses of each outcome [Rothman et al.,2010]. For jointly modeling multiple correlated outcomes in GWAS, we have developed a statisitcal method in this paper.</description>

      <description>Introduction Sparse regression is a useful technique to do variable selection, and achieve Bias-Variance tradeoff. The lasso is a popular tool for sparse regression, especially for problems in which the number of variables \(p\) exceeds the number of observations \(n\).
To minimize a general loss penalized by the adaptive Lasso, we have developed a new algorithm Fabs based on the BLasso. Specifically, Fabs produces solutions for minimizing following objective function with a sequence of tuning \(\lambda\) \[ L(\beta) + \lambda \sum_j w_j|\beta_j|, \] where \(w=(w_1, \dots, w_p)^\top\) is a vector of prefixed weights.</description>
