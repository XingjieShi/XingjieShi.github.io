      <description>Introduction It is common to have multiple outcomes of interest in a single study. Usually, these outcomes are analysed separately, ignoring the correlation between them. In high dimensional setting, one would expect that a carefully designed multivariate approach would be a more efficient alternative to individual analyses of each outcome [cite]. For jointly modeling multiple correlated outcomes, we have developed the method vimco. Here we provide same demonstrations.
Assume we have measured \(q\) responses \(y_1, \dots, y_q\) and the same set of \(p\) predictors on each individual \(x_1,\dots, x_p\).</description>
